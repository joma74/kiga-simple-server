How does one explain to kindergarden-kids what your IT job is about?

I was offered to talk about my job at the kindergarden. This is how i managed to excite them for tech.

First I asked them about different hardware factors the know - the laptop, the tablet, the mobile.
Next about how many of them have each at home.

After that i presented them a web page on the laptop, displaying those hardware factors as icons and 0 numbers.
I explained to them that i now explain to the computer waht i want by typing, so reading and writing is important.
that i want him to display those numbers. So coded the HTML 

Let them see them first on mobile  
On the browser and on the mobile.
